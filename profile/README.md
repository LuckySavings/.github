🌟 What is Lucky Savings?

Lucky Savings is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Kaia Chain, designed to bring secure, gamified savings to everyday users.

Accessible via:
	•	📱 LINE App (200M+ monthly active users in Asia)
	•	🌐 WebApp

We combine the excitement of a lottery with the safety of traditional savings.

🎲 Concept Explanation

🔹 Lossless Lottery Model
	•	Your deposits remain safe — they are never at risk.
	•	The yield (interest generated from pooled assets in DeFi) funds the prize pool.
	•	Every deposit = lottery tickets → more chances to win.

🔹 LINE Integration
	•	LINE is more than a chat app — it’s a lifestyle platform in Japan, Thailand, and Taiwan.
	•	Lucky Savings integrates directly in LINE, making participation as easy as sending a message.
	•	No need for deep blockchain knowledge — it’s simple, familiar, and fun.

🔹 Powered by Kaia Chain
	•	Built on an EVM-compatible blockchain.
	•	🚀 Fast, secure, and user-friendly.
	•	✨ Supports account abstraction & gas fee delegation → smoother onboarding for non-crypto users.

💎 Unique Value Proposition
	•	No Risk to Your Capital → principal stays safe, only yield funds the lottery.
	•	Frictionless UX → available inside LINE & WebApp.
	•	Community-first → designed for accessibility in Asia’s largest communication ecosystem.

Every deposit has the potential to bring luck, turning your savings journey into something exciting.
